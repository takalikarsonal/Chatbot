# Chatbot

**Rule-Based Chatbot**: A simple pattern-based chatbot that responds to predefined queries using the NLTK library.

## Features

- Responds to simple questions and greetings using predefined patterns.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NLTK library

## How It Works

This chatbot uses predefined patterns and responses defined in the pairs dictionary. It listens for specific inputs and returns an appropriate response. The conversation continues until the user types "bye".
Example:
You: Hi
Chatbot: Hello!

## Customizing the Chatbots

You can modify the pairs dictionary in the rule_based_chatbot.py file to add new patterns and responses.
